## features

The main feature of TermDo will be the ability separate different projects into
different todo lists 

## UI design inspiration 

The UI design for TermDo came from my time using PSQL within the terminal, I 
always liked the way I was able to interact with my db through PSQL. 
Which is I am trying to model TermDo to have a similar interface.
